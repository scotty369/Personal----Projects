#### Key Insight:

-   **Residential areas** are the most common settings for criminal incidents, followed closely by **public locations** such as streets and sidewalks. These findings underscore the need for improved safety measures in both private homes and public spaces.

### *2. Age Ranges of Offenders vs Victims*

The following charts show the age distributions of both offenders and victims, offering insights into the typical age groups involved in these incidents.

#### Key Insight:

-   **Offenders**: The most common age group among offenders is **20–29**, followed by **30–39**. This indicates that younger adults are more likely to be involved in criminal activities.

-   **Victims**: Victimization also peaks in the **20–29** age group, suggesting a strong overlap between the ages of offenders and victims. This may reflect social or environmental factors influencing both offending and victimization patterns.

### *3. Ethnicities of the Offenders vs Victims*

The charts below compare the ethnicities of offenders and victims to reveal potential patterns of racial disparities in criminal incidents.

#### Key Insight:

-   The majority of both **offenders** and **victims** are categorized as **non-Hispanic and non-Latino**. This suggests that ethnic groups outside of the Hispanic/Latino community are more frequently involved in criminal incidents. Further analysis is needed to explore the sociocultural and systemic factors behind these patterns.

### 4. *Races of Offenders vs Victims*

#### Key Insight:

-   **Offenders**: Both **White** and **African American** individuals are most commonly represented among offenders, highlighting possible broader societal and economic influences.

-   **Victims**: **White** individuals appear to be more frequently victimized, suggesting potential interactions between race, geographic location, and social dynamics. This warrants further investigation into how systemic factors contribute to these disparities.

### *5. Types of Offenses Committed*

#### Key Insight:

-   **Personal weapons** (hands, fists, etc.) are the most frequently used in incidents, followed by **firearms** and **knives**. The prominence of physical altercations emphasizes the need for preventive measures around conflict de-escalation, while the prevalence of firearms and knives highlights the importance of effective weapon control.

### *7. Relationship Between Offenders and Victims*

#### Key Insight:

-   The most common relationship between offenders and victims is that of **strangers**, where no prior connection exists between the parties. Other significant relationships include **boyfriends/girlfriends**, **friends**, **spouses**, and **acquaintances**. This indicates a range of scenarios, from random violence to incidents stemming from interpersonal conflicts.

## *Conclusion*

This analysis uncovers several critical patterns in criminal activity related to gun violence. Key findings include:

-   Younger individuals, particularly in their 20s and 30s, are more likely to be involved both as offenders and victims.

-   The most common offenses involve property destruction, assaults, and drug-related crimes.

-   Both **White** and **African American** individuals are most commonly represented among offenders, while **White** individuals are more frequently victimized.

-   **Personal weapons** and **firearms** are the most common weapons used in violent incidents.

These insights are crucial for understanding the social dynamics behind gun violence. By further exploring these trends and integrating additional datasets, law enforcement agencies and policymakers can make more informed decisions about crime prevention, resource allocation, and public safety initiatives.
